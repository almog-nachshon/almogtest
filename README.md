# CI/CD Strategy for Node.js Monorepo

## üì¶ Section 1: Context & Assumptions
- **Repo Structure**: Monorepo managed by Nx; services under `apps/`, shared code in `packages/`.
- **Team Scale**: Approximately 30 engineers.
- **Service Interdependencies**: High, with 180+ micro-services sharing common utilities.
- **Test Coverage**: Target coverage is 80% or higher per service.
- **Release Policy**: Frequent releases (~5/week), semantic versioning for each service.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Section 2: Continuous Integration (CI)

### 2.1 Recommended CI Tooling
- **Tool**: Nx Cloud combined with GitHub Actions.
- **Justification**:
  - **Nx** provides robust dependency analysis and intelligent affected build detection.
  - **Nx Cloud** enhances build speed through caching.
  - **GitHub Actions** offers easy integration, scalability, and extensibility.

### 2.2 Detecting Changed Services & Selective CI
1. Detect changed services using Nx:
   ```bash
   nx affected:graph --base=origin/main --head=HEAD
   ```
2. Run tests, builds, and lint only on affected services:
   ```yaml
   steps:
     - name: Affected Test
       run: nx affected:test --base=origin/main --head=HEAD

     - name: Affected Lint
       run: nx affected:lint --base=origin/main --head=HEAD
   ```

### 2.3 Caching Strategy
- **Nx Cloud**: Caches build/test outputs, drastically reducing subsequent CI times.
- **GitHub Actions Cache**: Stores frequently-used dependencies.
  ```yaml
  - name: Cache Dependencies
    uses: actions/cache@v3
    with:
      path: '**/node_modules'
      key: ${{ runner.os }}-modules-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
  ```

### 2.4 Handling Specific Scenarios

#### 2.4.1 Linting and Testing per Service
- Each service includes individual lint and test configurations.
  ```bash
  nx affected:lint --base=origin/main --head=HEAD
  nx affected:test --base=origin/main --head=HEAD
  ```

#### 2.4.2 Shared Library Changes
- Any shared library change triggers CI runs for downstream dependent services:
  ```bash
  nx affected:test --base=origin/main --head=HEAD
  ```

### 2.5 Strategies for CI Pipeline Performance
- Use parallelism in GitHub Actions workflows to improve build and test speed:
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    test:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      strategy:
        matrix:
          service: [service1, service2, service3]
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - run: nx test ${{ matrix.service }}
  ```
- Regular dependency updates scheduled weekly to prevent large disruptive changes.

### 2.6 Alternative Approach: GitHub Actions with Helm and Argo CD
- Separate branches for each environment (`prod`, `stage`, `dev`, `test`) containing Helm charts.
- Each branch synced via Argo CD for automated and declarative deployments.
- GitHub Actions workflows triggered on branch commits push updated Helm charts, triggering Argo CD sync.

Example workflow snippet:

```yaml
name: Helm Chart Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - prod
      - stage
      - dev
      - test

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/DevOpsRole-${{ github.ref_name }}
          aws-region: us-east-1
      - name: Package and Push Helm Chart
        run: |
          helm package ./helm/${{ github.ref_name }} -d ./helm-repo
          aws s3 sync ./helm-repo s3://my-helm-chart-repo/${{ github.ref_name }}
```

## üöÄ Section 3: Continuous Deployment (CD)

### 3.1 Deploying Affected Services Only
- Determine affected deployments:
  ```bash
  nx affected:build --base=origin/main --head=HEAD
  ```

### 3.2 Environment Management
- Branch-based deployments:
  - **main** ‚Üí Dev (auto-deploy)
  - **staging** ‚Üí Staging (auto-deploy)
  - Tags (`prod-v*`) ‚Üí Production (manual approval)
- Canary deployments handle 10% traffic, monitored closely for regressions.

### 3.3 GitOps vs Push-Based Deployment
- **GitOps**: Use Argo CD for Kubernetes manifest synchronization.
- Example manifest update:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: my-service
  spec:
    replicas: 3
    template:
      spec:
        containers:
          - name: my-service
            image: my-service:${{ github.sha }}
  ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Section 4: Challenges & Tradeoffs

### 4.1 Key Challenges
- **Pipeline Complexity**: Mitigated by selective builds and parallel jobs.
- **Dependency Management**: Regular scheduled updates and automated testing.
- **Secrets Management**: Centralized, encrypted secrets with automated rotation.
- **Deployment Risks**: Managed through Canary deployments and rollback automation.
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging and real-time monitoring through Prometheus and Grafana.

### 4.2 Tradeoffs
- GitOps provides consistent deployments but adds complexity in manifest management.
- Aggressive caching boosts performance but must be managed carefully to avoid stale caches.
- Parallelization improves speed but increases CI/CD infrastructure costs.
