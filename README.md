# CI/CD Strategy for Node.js Monorepo

## üì¶ Section 1: Context & Assumptions
- **Repo Structure**: Monorepo managed by Nx; services under `apps/`, shared code in `packages/`.
- **Team Scale**: Approximately 30 engineers.
- **Service Interdependencies**: High, with 180+ micro-services sharing common utilities.
- **Test Coverage**: Target coverage is 80% or higher per service.
- **Release Policy**: Frequent releases (~5/week), semantic versioning for each service.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Section 2: Continuous Integration (CI)

### 2.1 Recommended CI Tooling
- **Tool**: Nx Cloud combined with GitHub Actions.
- **Justification**:
  - **Nx** provides robust dependency analysis and intelligent affected build detection.
  - **Nx Cloud** enhances build speed through caching.
  - **GitHub Actions** offers easy integration, scalability, and extensibility.

### 2.2 Detecting Changed Services & Selective CI
1. Detect changed services using Nx:
   ```bash
   nx affected:graph --base=origin/main --head=HEAD
   ```
2. Run tests, builds, and lint only on affected services:
   ```yaml
   steps:
     - name: Affected Test
       run: nx affected:test --base=origin/main --head=HEAD

     - name: Affected Lint
       run: nx affected:lint --base=origin/main --head=HEAD
   ```

### 2.3 Caching Strategy
- **Nx Cloud**: Caches build/test outputs, drastically reducing subsequent CI times.
- **GitHub Actions Cache**: Stores frequently-used dependencies.
  ```yaml
  - name: Cache Dependencies
    uses: actions/cache@v3
    with:
      path: '**/node_modules'
      key: ${{ runner.os }}-modules-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
  ```

### 2.4 Handling Specific Scenarios

#### 2.4.1 Linting and Testing per Service
- Each service includes individual lint and test configurations.
  ```bash
  nx affected:lint --base=origin/main --head=HEAD
  nx affected:test --base=origin/main --head=HEAD
  ```

#### 2.4.2 Shared Library Changes
- Any shared library change triggers CI runs for downstream dependent services:
  ```bash
  nx affected:test --base=origin/main --head=HEAD
  ```

### 2.5 Strategies for CI Pipeline Performance
- Use parallelism in GitHub Actions workflows to improve build and test speed:
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    test:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      strategy:
        matrix:
          service: [service1, service2, service3]
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - run: nx test ${{ matrix.service }}
  ```
- Regular dependency updates scheduled weekly to prevent large disruptive changes.

## üöÄ Section 3: Continuous Deployment (CD)

### 3.1 Deploying Affected Services Only
- Determine affected deployments:
  ```bash
  nx affected:build --base=origin/main --head=HEAD
  ```

### 3.2 Environment Management
- Branch-based deployments:
  - **main** ‚Üí Dev (auto-deploy)
  - **staging** ‚Üí Staging (auto-deploy)
  - Tags (`prod-v*`) ‚Üí Production (manual approval)
- Canary deployments handle 10% traffic, monitored closely for regressions.

### 3.3 GitOps vs Push-Based Deployment
- **GitOps**: Use Argo CD for Kubernetes manifest synchronization.
- Example manifest update:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: my-service
  spec:
    replicas: 3
    template:
      spec:
        containers:
          - name: my-service
            image: my-service:${{ github.sha }}
  ```

### 3.4 Rollback Plan & Observability
- Automatic rollback mechanism if Canary deployment shows high error rates (>1%).
- Observability via Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards.
- Example rollback trigger:
  ```yaml
  annotations:
    prometheus.io/scrape: 'true'
    prometheus.io/path: '/metrics'
  ```

### 3.5 Managing Secrets & Config
- Store secrets using SOPS-encrypted YAML files in Git.
- Runtime injection via External Secrets Operator:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
  kind: ExternalSecret
  metadata:
    name: db-credentials
  spec:
    secretStoreRef:
      kind: SecretStore
      name: aws-secrets-manager
    target:
      name: db-credentials
    data:
      - secretKey: username
        remoteRef:
          key: database/username
      - secretKey: password
        remoteRef:
          key: database/password
  ```

### 3.6 EKS Node Structure
- Use dedicated node pools:
  - High-CPU nodes for compute-intensive tasks.
  - General-purpose nodes for standard workloads.
  - Autoscaling via Kubernetes Autoscaler/Karpenter based on service metrics.

### 3.7 Definition of Successful Deployment
- All smoke tests pass post-deployment.
- Metrics in Prometheus remain within defined thresholds.
- No critical alerts triggered in monitoring systems.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Section 4: Challenges & Tradeoffs

### 4.1 Key Challenges
- **Pipeline Complexity**: Mitigated by selective builds and parallel jobs.
- **Dependency Management**: Regular scheduled updates and automated testing.
- **Secrets Management**: Centralized, encrypted secrets with automated rotation.
- **Deployment Risks**: Managed through Canary deployments and rollback automation.
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging and real-time monitoring through Prometheus and Grafana.

### 4.2 Tradeoffs
- GitOps provides consistent deployments but adds complexity in manifest management.
- Aggressive caching boosts performance but must be managed carefully to avoid stale caches.
- Parallelization improves speed but increases CI/CD infrastructure costs.
